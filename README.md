# Compress JPEG

Compress JPEG is a python script that takes a directory or file path as a
parameter. If the path is a directory, all image files within the directory
will be reduced in size (to a certain limit). If the path is an image file, the
single image will be reduced in size.

## Usage
```
python3 compressjpeg.py path
```

## Dependencies
Pillow (https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/) v7.1.2
